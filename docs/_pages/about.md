CamViz tool is used to visualize images from different cameras by subscribing to topics.



## Local installation on Linux machines

The programming framework is composed of the ROS1 and ROS2 middleware, GtK based GUI and the JdeRobot base package. All this software is open source so there are alternative ways to install all of them directly from the source code. Currently we use ROS Melodic, ROS Dashing and JdeRobot-Academy (20180606) releases. Follow the <a href="/installation/#ubuntudebian/">installation recipe</a> in the github repository to get the framework up and running, ready to use on your computer.
